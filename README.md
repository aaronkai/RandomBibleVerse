# RandomBibleVerse

Just a proof of concept using JS and Vite, hosted on Cloudflare.

This project was part of my attempt to learn more about backends, TypeScript, and fetch. 

The site pulls a random verse from an API and displays it for the user. User can also pull the preceding and antecedent verses as well. 

The logic is not sophisticated enough to traverse chapters or books.
